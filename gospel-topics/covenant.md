## Covenant

### Yet I loved Jacob
I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, And I hated Esau,[^1] and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. (Malachi 1:2-3)

### The people against whom the Lord hath indigation forever
Whereas Edom[^2] saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever. (Malachi 1:4)

[^1]: I believe the principle taught here is that God reserves unique love and blessings for His covenant children.
[^2]: Edom refers to the nation that came from Esau.

\chapter{Testimonies of Jesus Christ}

\section{Old Testament}

\paragraph{Out of thee shall come forth unto me a ruler in Israel}
But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. (Micah 5:2)\index{Micah 5:2}

\paragraph{I called my son out of Egypt}
When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. (Hosea 11:1)\footnote{Matthew interprets this verse to be referring to the Messiah and the time He spent in Egypt as a young child as a fulfillment of this prophecy. Traditionally, Hosea's prophecy is thought to refer to the exodus of Israel from Egypt.}

\section{Of His Divine Birth}

\paragraph{Where is he that is born King of the Jews?}
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. (Matthew 2:1-2)

\paragraph{in Bethlehem, for thus it is written by the prophet}
When Herod the king had heard all these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people\footnote{the Sanhedrin} together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet.\footnote{Micah 5:2} (Matthew 2:3-5)

\paragraph{Shall not Christ come out of Bethlehem?}
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? (John 7:42)\footnote{This question is asked by the people in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukot) and shows that it was common knowledge at the time that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.}

\paragraph{and departed into Egypt}
When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,\footnote{Hosea 11:1} saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. (Matthew 2:14-15)

\paragraph{and shall be called the Son of the Highest}
Fear not, Mary: for thou has found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest (Luke 1:30-32)

\paragraph{he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever}
and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. (Luke 1:32-33)

\paragraph{[He] shall be called the son of God}
And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. (Luke 1:35)

\paragraph{he hath redeemed his people}
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; ... To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant. The oath which he sware to our father Abraham. That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. (Luke 1:68-69, 72-75)

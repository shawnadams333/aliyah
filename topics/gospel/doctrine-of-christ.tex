\chapter{Doctrine of Jesus Christ}

\section{Definitions}

\begin{quotation}
The steps God revealed we must take to follow Jesus and receive eternal life are called the doctrine of Christ. They include "faithin Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism [into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints], receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end." (Do You Know Why I as a Christian Believe in Christ?, Ahmad S. Corbitt, April 2023 General Conference)
\end{quotation}

As he was explaining Lehi's teachings about the scattering and gathering of Israel to Laman and Lemuel, Nephi explains the basic notion of the doctrine of Christ. He says of their seed in the latter days

\begin{quotation}
wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved. (1 Nephi 15:14)
\end{quotation}

\section{Promises}

\begin{quotation}
The pure doctrine of Christ is powerful. It changes the life of everyone who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life. The doctrine of Christ helps us find and stay on the covenant path. Staying on that narrow but well-defined path will ultimately qualify us to receive all that God has. (Pure Truth, Pure Doctrine, and Pure Revelation, Russell M. Nelson, October 2021 General Conference)

\section{Scriptures}

\begin{quotation}
And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam. 

And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon all men, that all might stand before him at the great and judgment day. 

And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.

And if they will not repent and believe on his name, and be baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it (2 Nephi 9:21-24).
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
And he gave [the Church organization] for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ... (Ephesians 4:11-13).
\end{quotation}

When Nephi is explaining Lehi's vision to Laman and Lemuel (1 Nephi 15:12-14), he seems to equate the fulness of the gospel to two things:

\begin{itemize}
  \item authority to perform all ordinances necessary for salvation
  \item understanding of what the doctrine of Christ is
\end{itemize}

\begin{quotation}
And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; \emphasis{wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.} (1 Nephi 15:14)
\end{quotation}

\paragraph{The Fruit of the Tree of Life}
Lehi sees the tree of Life in his vision. He describes the fruit of the tree of life, and it's effect on him, like this:

\begin{quotation}
And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.

And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.

And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy;
\end{quotation}

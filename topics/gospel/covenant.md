# Covenant

## All are equal before God

## Covenant breakers

### Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau
I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, And I hated Esau,[^1] and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. (Malachi 1:2-3)

> God established His covenant with Jacob and Esau's parents (Isaac and Rebeccah) and grandparents (Abraham and Sarah). Esau sold his birthright (Genesis 25:29-34) to Jacob thereby breaking the covenant. If both Esau and Isaac would have been righteous, would both have been included in the covenant family? Since God is no respecter of persons, I think the answer must be 'yes'.

### The people against whom the Lord hath indigation forever
Whereas Edom[^2] saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down;[^3] and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.[^4] (Malachi 1:4)

### Neither will I accept an offering at your hand
Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine alter for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. (Malachi 1:10)

"Oh that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not light useless fires on my alter! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD Almighty, "and I will accept no offering from your hands." (Malachi 1:10 NIV)

## Gentiles

### My name shall be great among the Gentiles
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 1:11)


[^1]: I believe the principle taught here is that God reserves unique love and blessings for His covenant children.
[^2]: Edom refers to the nation that came from Esau.
[^3]: The descendants of Esau didn't make a covenant, but they appear to be cursed, as the descendants of Laman and Lemuel were.
[^4]: Indignation forever? Is there a way for the Edomites to be redeemed?

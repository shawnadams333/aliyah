# Covenant

## All are equal before God

## Covenant breakers

### Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau
I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, And I hated Esau,[^1] and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. (Malachi 1:2-3)

> God established His covenant with Jacob and Esau's parents (Isaac and Rebeccah) and grandparents (Abraham and Sarah). Esau sold his birthright (Genesis 25:29-34) to Jacob thereby breaking the covenant. If both Esau and Isaac would have been righteous, would both have been included in the covenant family? Since God is no respecter of persons, I think the answer must be 'yes'.

### The people against whom the Lord hath indigation forever
Whereas Edom[^2] saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down;[^3] and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.[^4] (Malachi 1:4)

### Ye offer polluted bread
Ye offer polluted bread upon mine alter; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 1:7-8)

### But now entreat God's favor
But now entreat God's favor, That he may be gracious to us. While this is being done by your hands, will He accept you favorably? Says the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 1:9 New KJV)

### Neither will I accept an offering at your hand
Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine alter for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. (Malachi 1:10)

"Oh that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not light useless fires on my alter! I am not pleased with you," says the LORD Almighty, "and I will accept no offering from your hands." (Malachi 1:10 NIV)

### I will send a curse upon you
And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. (Malachi 2:1-2)

### I will rebuke your seed
Behold, I will [rebuke] your seed,[^5] and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it. (Malachi 2:3)

### But ye are departed out of the way
But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. (Malachi 2:8-9)

### Hath married the daughter of a strange god
Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 2:11-12)

## Gentiles

### My name shall be great among the Gentiles
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 1:11)


[^1]: I believe the principle taught here is that God reserves unique love and blessings for His covenant children.
[^2]: Edom refers to the nation that came from Esau.
[^3]: The descendants of Esau didn't make a covenant, but they appear to be cursed, as the descendants of Laman and Lemuel were.
[^4]: Indignation forever? Is there a way for the Edomites to be redeemed?
[^5]: I'm not sure I know what this means. Do the children of covenant breakers suffer for the sins of their parents?

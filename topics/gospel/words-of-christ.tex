\chapter{Words of Jesus Christ}

\section{New Testament}

The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. (Mark 1:15)

Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. (Mark 1:17)

Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. (Matthew 4:19)

Hold thy peace, and come out of him. (Mark 1:25)

Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for therefore came I forth. (Mark 1:38)

I will; be thou clean. (Mark 1:41)

\paragraph{The temptations of Jesus}
It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. (Matthew 4:4) (Luke 4:4)

It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. (Matthew 4:7) (Luke 4:12)

Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. (Matthew 4:10) (Luke 4:8)

\paragraph{In the synagogue in Nazareth}
The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\footnote{perhaps referring to the Year of Jubilee, in which slaves are freed and debts are forgiven as prescribed in Leviticus 25:8-13} (Luke 4:18-19)

This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. (Luke 4:21)

Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. (Luke 4:23)

Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias,\footnote{Greek for of Elijah} when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; But unto none of them was Elias\footnotemark[\value{footnote}] sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus\footnote{Greek form of Elisha} the prophet; and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian. (Luke 4:24-27)

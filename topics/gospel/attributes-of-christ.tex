\chapter{Attributes of Jesus Christ}

\paragraph{He knew all men}
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. (John 2:23-25)

\mt{Interestingly, John tells of several encounters in the next couple chapters that illustrate Jesus' knowledge of the people around him such as Nicodemus (John 3:1-21), the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:5-26), and the Nobleman from Capernaum (John 4:46-54).}

# The Second Coming of Jesus Christ


### I will send my messenger
Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 3:1)

### He is like a refiner's fire
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like a fuller's soap: And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. (Malachi 1:2-3)

### Then shall the offering of Judah be pleasant
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.(Malachi 1:4)

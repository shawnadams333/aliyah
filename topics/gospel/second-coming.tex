\chapter{The Second Coming of Jesus Christ}


\section{The preparation}

\begin{quotation}
Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 3:1)
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. (Malachi 4:5-6)
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
And he [John the Baptist] shall go before him [the Lord] in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. (Luke 1:17)\footnote{I know this verse is about the Messiah's first coming, but I can't help but think that a similar preparation needs to occur before His second coming. What does a people 'prepared for the Lord' look like?}
\end{quotation}


\section{The gathering}

\begin{quotation}
And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever, saith the Father (3 Nephi 20:29).
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Then will the Father gather them together again, and give unto them Jerusalem for the land of their inheritance (3 Nephi 20:33).
\end{quotation}


\section{The refiner's fire}

\begin{quotation}
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like a fuller's soap: And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. (Malachi 1:2-3)
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be as stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. (Malachi 4:1)
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.(Malachi 1:4)
\end{quotation}


\section{A judgement}

\begin{quotation}
And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 3:5)
\end{quotation}


\section{The righteous}

\begin{quotation}
Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of rememberance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. (Malachi 3:16-17)
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves in the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. (Malachi 4:2-3)
\end{quotation}
